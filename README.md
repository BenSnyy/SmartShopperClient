# SmartshopperClient

Welcome to the Smart Shopper App! The purpose of this application is to allow users to log their grocieries at home with Create, Read, Update, and Delete, as well as to create a shopping list for the grocery store with the same functionality.

Administrators also have the ability to view and delete all users.

The purpose of this is to have a "one stop shop" for people at the store to look at what they have at home and when it expires so that shopping can be more efficient, wasting less time, money, and food.  

Below, you can find information on the deployment and how to launch the application.
